Wine Analysis for Udacity Nanodegree Programme

What is it about

The dataset is taken from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews 
The goal was to look at which variables impact the quality of the wine and whether it can be predicted.

The GridSearch approach was inspired by this article on Hyperparameter Tuning: https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperparameter-tuning-the-random-forest-in-python-using-scikit-learn-28d2aa77dd74
